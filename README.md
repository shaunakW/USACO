# USACO Problems
All the USACO problems I've attempted (in C++).
They are split into 3 categories:
- Competition problems
- Practice problems
- Problems from the Starleague Gold class

### [usaco.bat](usaco.bat) (and [create.py](create.py))
This is a shell script to generate all the necessary files for a USACO problem in the proper folder.
(requires python installed)
